## Linked OpenStreetMap

**L**inked **O**pen**S**treet**M**ap is an effort to make the live and historic versions of OpenStreetMap queryable on the client-side. It uses Linked Data and the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to decentralize derived data publishing.

### Our projects

#### Road network route planning

 * [Routable Tiles specification](https://openplanner.team/specs/2018-11-routable-tiles.html): the specification of the Web API of routable tiles
 * [Routable Tiles Ontology](https://github.com/openplannerteam/routable-tiles-ontology): a mapping of the OSM entities and tags to a Linked Data vocabulary.
 * [Main routables tiles dataset](https://tiles.openplanner.team/planet/14/8411/5485/): a live routable tiles instance for public adoption.
 * Transit Tiles specification: _todo_
 * Transit Tiles datasets: _todo_

Using [Planner.js](https://planner.js.org), you can create your own custom route planner.

Using the [Profile Ontology](https://github.com/openplannerteam/profile-ontology) you can define how a route planner must interpret the OSM tags when routing using a specific transport mode.

#### Comunica

In Comunica, it will soon become possible to use GeoSPARQL to query for feature in OSM. Demo coming soon.

We are only starting. Do [join our slack](https://join.slack.com/t/openplanner/shared_invite/zt-781ymf0m-3SmsaDS40b_by8MXimV9aQ) if you want to discuss about developing this Linked Data version of the OpenStreetMap dataset!
